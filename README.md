# How to Use:

To use simple follow below steps:
## Step 1: 
Add this code in body section in html wherever you want
```
<p
data-textscript-strings="Hello,Welcome to TextScript!,Enjoy the typing animation!"
data-textscript-typespeed="50"
data-textscript-backspeed="50"
data-textscript-loop="true">
</p>
```
not limiting to paragraph tag you can also add heading tags like
```
<h1
data-textscript-strings="Hello,Welcome to TextScript!,Enjoy the typing animation!"
data-textscript-typespeed="50"
data-textscript-backspeed="50"
data-textscript-loop="true">
</h1>
```
and
```
<h6
data-textscript-strings="Hello,Welcome to TextScript!,Enjoy the typing animation!"
data-textscript-typespeed="50"
data-textscript-backspeed="50"
data-textscript-loop="true">
</h6>
```

## Step 2: 
Setup accordingly like set type-speed and back-speed of your choice in milliseconds.
## Step 3:
You can set
`data-textscript-loop="false"`
to stop repeating the text, the animation will continue only for one time for all values in the string and will enduo after some it does and no text will be displayed.
## Step 4:
All values in
`data-textscript-string="x,y,z"`
must be seperated by commas.
